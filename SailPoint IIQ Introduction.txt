Introduction to SailPoint
-------------------------
Before diving into SailPoint, it's essential to understand IAM (Identity and Access Management).

What is IAM?
------------
IAM is a concept, framework, or subdomain of cybersecurity. It ensures secure and appropriate access to systems, applications, and data.

IAM Principles – Least Privilege:
Providing the right access to the right identity at the right time to the right resources.

Right Access Means:
- Users have correct roles and entitlements
- Managing passwords correctly and timely
- Access is reviewed periodically

Right Time – LCM (Lifecycle Management):
IAM uses LCM to manage identity from:
- Joining
- Transfers
- Termination

IAM tools help automate these processes.

Example: If an employee changes departments, their access should reflect their new responsibilities.

Also, access reviews help ensure access is granted only when needed.

What is an Identity?
--------------------
In IAM, a user is called an identity in digital world.

Types of Identities:
- Human identities: Employees, contractors, third-party vendors
- Non-human identities: IoT devices, RPA bots, service/system accounts

Why is IAM Important?
---------------------
IAM addresses major challenges:
- Data breaches: Prevents misuse of sensitive data like bank info or personal records
- Server misuse
- Boosts productivity by automating access processes

Key IAM Components
------------------
Authentication:
Verifying the user is legitimate (e.g., username + password)

Authorization:
Verifying the user has permissions to access or perform a specific task
